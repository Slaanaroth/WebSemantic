# Semantic Web Project
### Merlin BARZILAI & Corentin MARIONNEAU
This is the repository of the Semantic Web project where we converted a dataset listing the research projects awarded with the scientific excellence bonus in France to 5-star open data.

In this repository you can find everything we used to generate our RDF graph from the following CSV file : [Initial dataset](https://data.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/explore/dataset/fr-esr-pes-pedr-beneficiaires/)

# Repository structure

## Building

You can find in `/building` sevaral files used to build our rdf graph :
* `fr-esr-pes-pedr-beneficiaires.csv` : the source csv file
* `builder.sh` : a script which runs the tarql software to generate our first graph
* `builderSameAs.sh` : a script which runs the tarql software to generate the graph with added `owl:sameAs` properties
* `builder.sparql` : the sparql script used to generate the first graph
* `builderSameAs.sparql` : the sparql script used to generate the graph with added `owl:sameAs` properties

## Inferences

You can find in `/inferences` sevaral files used to generate RDFS inferences on our graph :
* `ontology.ttl` : the Turtle RDF file defining the ontology to generate
* `InferenceGeneration.java` : the Java class which generates the inferences and writes them in a new graph (using Jena)


## Queries

You can find in `/queries` 2 different queries we designed for our graph :
* `query1.sparql` : a query which selects the number of people awarded of each gender for each year
* `query2.sparql` : a query which selects the number of bonus receiving groups for each area of research for each year

## RDF

You can find in `/rdf` the different graphs we generated during the project :
* `graph.ttl` : the first graph we generated with tarql by mapping the csv to turtle triples
* `graphWithRDFS.ttl` : the second graph we generated with Jena by adding RDFS inferences to the first graph
* `graphSameAs.ttl` : the third graph we generated with tarql like the first one but by adding `owl:sameAs` properties in the builder script
* `graphSameAsWithRDFS.ttl` : the fourth graph we generated with Jena by adding RDFS inferences to the third graph
* `graphFinal.ttl` : the last graph we generated by adding VOID metadata to the fourth graph with Jena
* `their_graph.ttl` : the graph created by another group we tried to use for multi-graph queries

## VOID

You can find in `/void` sevaral files used to add VOID metadata to our graph :
* `metadata.sparql` : the sparql script we translated in Jena Java to design the metadata we wanted to add
* `MetadataGeneration.java` : the Java class which adds the metadata to the graph and writes them in a new graph (using Jena)
